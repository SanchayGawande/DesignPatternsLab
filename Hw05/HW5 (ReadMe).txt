HomeWork Assignment 5In HomeWork Assignment 5, I created The Weather Data Monitoring System.The Weather Data Monitoring System is a Java application that demonstrates the Observer design pattern. It tracks real-time weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, notifying observers about changes. Key components include the WeatherData subject and observer classes like CurrentConditionsDisplay, StatisticsDisplay, and ForecastDisplay. This example showcases how observers receive weather updates and update their displays, illustrating the Observer pattern's flexibility.
