HomeWork Assignment 4In HomeWork Assignment 4, I created The Fan Control System. The Fan Control System is a Java application that simulates the control of a fan with different speed levels. It uses the state design pattern to manage the fan's state transitions and provides functionality to turn the fan on/off, increase/decrease its speed, and toggle between speed levels (low, medium, high, off).The code is organized into several classes, including FanContext, FanState, and concrete state classes like LowState, MediumState, HighState, and OffState.
